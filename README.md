# CS-350-Journal

The final project presented a unique problem to solve. We needed to create a program for the CC3220 LaunchPad that simulated an operational thermostat. To accomplish this, both buttons on the board were used to change the set temperature. The red LED indicated that the heat was turned on. The thermal sensor was used to keep track of changes in temperature in predetermined intervals. 

I implemented the thermal sensor well in this assignment; the sensor keeps track of the temperature and turns the red LED on when the right conditions are met. While initially tricky, I feel I implemented the code effectively and efficiently for the task at hand. However, I think the state machine I implemented for button presses is a little redundant and could certainly be rewritten more efficiently. 

Throughout this course, I have gained invaluable experience with C# to add to my support network. This course was my first crack at embedded design and implementation, but I feel these new skills will also translate well into my support network. 

CS 350 has bolstered my problem-solving skills, which will help me in my future courses here at SNHU. In addition, my newfound knowledge of designing and implementing state machines will undoubtedly come in handy and should prove entertaining to implement in future course work. 

My work on this project will be open source, allowing other developers to adapt my work into their own and improve upon it. I followed the standard coding conventions with indentation, naming conventions, and commenting, all of which helped ensure this project is readable and adaptable.
